Hebrews 4:12
For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.

Psalm 119:105
Your word is a lamp for my feet,
    a light on my path.

John 1:5
The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.
